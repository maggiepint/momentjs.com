title: Where to use it

To use moment-timezone, you will need `moment@2.6.0+`, `moment-timezone.js`, and the `moment-timezone` data.

For convenience, there are builds available on [momentjs.com/timezone/](/timezone/) with all the zone data or a subset of the data with support for only 2010-2020.
